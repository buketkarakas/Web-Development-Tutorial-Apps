        <p>
          I am doing a major in Computer Science and Engineering in Sabanci University and minor in Decision and Behaviour. I was in Uppsala
          University for a semester.I participated in some biomechatronics projects to try out if I am interested in the subject and got the chance to work with
          valuable professors. I did my first internship in a financial company called Intertech where I also work as a long term software
          developer intern currently. I love Software Engineering and I follow technology blogs like TechCrunch and software blogs like <a href="https://medium.com/@buketkarakas">Medium</a>. I love nature and
          doing sports like Korfball, yoga and running. As long as I have coffe and sunsets, I can find something to be happy.<br />
